##This is a markdown file!
### This is a tertiary heading to practice!

This is my first markdown file. With markdown I plan on:

* Learning Markdown
* Make a random list to practice
* ???
* PROFIT!

I could even make this an ordered list! See?

# Learning Markdown
# Make a random list to practice (with numbers!)
# ???
# PROFIT!

Okay, I'm done! Thanks everyone!
Jason
